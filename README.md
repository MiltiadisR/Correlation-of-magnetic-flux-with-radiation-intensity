# Empirical Correlation Between EUV Emissions and Total Unsigned Magnetic Flux in Solar Active Regions

This project is the result of an undergraduate thesis focusing on the Sun—specifically, on solar active regions (ARs) observed in various wavelengths of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum. The goal of the study was to measure the intensity of emissions from these regions and correlate them with their **Total Unsigned Magnetic Flux (TUMF)**.

## Summary

A total of **127 solar active regions** were analyzed, selected to cover an entire solar cycle—both the solar maximum and minimum phases. The data used in this study was obtained from NASA’s **SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory)** mission.

The EUV wavelengths studied were:
- 94 Å
- 171 Å
- 193 Å
- 211 Å
- 94 Å (Hot channel)

The study revealed that the **strongest correlation** between EUV intensity and magnetic flux was found in the **hotter 94 Å channel**. Empirical relationships were derived that connect the observed EUV intensity in these wavelengths with the corresponding TUMF values of the active regions.

## Scientific Contribution

The findings of this work contribute to:
- Testing **coronal heating theories**
- Empirically estimating the **magnetic flux of active regions on the far side of the Sun** (not visible from Earth)

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python 3**
- Data from **SDO / AIA and HMI instruments**
- Libraries used include:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`
